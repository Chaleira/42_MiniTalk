# 42 Minitalk

Welcome to the 42 Minitalk project repository! This project is part of the 42 school curriculum and focuses on inter-process communication using signals in Unix systems.

## Introduction

The 42 Minitalk project involves implementing a client-server communication system using signals. The goal is to create two programs: a server program that waits for messages from a client and a client program that sends messages to the server. The messages exchanged between the client and server are strings of ASCII characters.

## Features

- Implementation of client-server communication using signals
- Message exchange between client and server using ASCII characters
- Reliable communication protocol to ensure message delivery
